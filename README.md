# Start the training 

Go to the server developer training and follow the [agenda](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/getting-started/server_training/ssdt-intro/#programme). There are 5 sessions or days; each session covers specific advanced resources of the platform. To achieve that, we are extending the Trade & Positions application that was created during the [Developer Training](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/getting-started/developer-training/training-intro/).
